# Kunena Birthday Module #
The Kunena Birthday Module shows up the birthdays of your users. You can setup how much, how far in future to show. You can totally adjust the module after your wishes. You can create your own template for the module. How the string looks like you can change in the language file.

You can choose between different user linkings: profile or forum thread

When you choose forum thread, it will automatically create a forum thread when a user have birthday with a predefined subject, category, botname and botid

It works also with JS and CB. You can not use the module without Kunena!

Minimum Requirement:
- PHP 5.2
- Joomla 1.6.0
- Kunena 1.6.0

If you have suggestion please write me an e-mail or post into the thread I opened in the Forum on kunena.com.

How to show the actual name instead of the username?
- Go to your Kunena configuration under the user tab and set the option "Display User Name" to NO to display the real name.
