# Kunena Birthday Module #
## Introduction ##
The Kunena Birthday Module shows the upcoming birthdays of your users. You can setup for example how much and to which date you want to display the birthdays. You can totally adjust the module after your wishes. Create your own template for the module, if you want or change the look of the string output over the language files or the Joomla! 2.5 build in language override.

#### You can choose between different user linkings ####
- Link to profile
- Link to a auto generated forum thread

You only need to add a Kunena category and a ID of an dummy user and the module will create a thread at the birthday of the an user. Feel free to change the subject string and/or the message. There is also a possibility to display the message in different languages.

#### The module supports ####
- JomSocial
- CommunityBuilder

#### Minimum Requirement ####
- PHP 5.2
- Joomla 1.6.0
- Kunena 1.6.0

If you have a suggestion or a problem please just write an issue in here or on kunena.org, where I setup a forum thread for the module.
