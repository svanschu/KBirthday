The Kunena Birthday Module shows up the birthdays of your users. You can setup how much, how far in future to show. You can totally adjust the module after your wishes. You can create your own template for the module. How the string looks like you can change in the language file.

You can choose between different reference time settings: server time, website offset, GMT or user offset

You can choose between different user linkings: profile or forum thread

When you choose forum thread, it will automatically create a forum thread when a user have birthday with a predefined subject, category, botname and botid

It works also with JS and CB. You can not use the module without Kunena!

Minimum Requirement:
Kunena 1.6.0

If you have suggestion please write me an e-mail or post into the thread I opened in the Forum on kunena.com.

See CHANGELOG for changes.
